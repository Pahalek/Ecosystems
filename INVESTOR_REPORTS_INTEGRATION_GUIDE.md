- **Excel Files**: Spreadsheet data and financial tables
- **Word Documents**: Text extraction and embedded tables

## üîß Integration Process

### Automated Extraction
The system automatically:
1. **Scans all files** in the investor_reports directory
2. **Extracts text and tables** using multiple parsing methods
3. **Identifies segment data** using pattern matching
4. **Structures the data** for econometric analysis
5. **Generates CSV/JSON outputs** for integration

### Pattern Recognition
The parser looks for:
- Revenue numbers with "AWS", "North America", "International"
- Growth percentages and operating margins
- Prime membership statistics
- Fulfillment and operational metrics
- Forward guidance statements

## üöÄ Usage

### Run the Integration System:

1. **Process Investor Reports:**
   ```bash
   D:/Econometric/.venv/Scripts/python.exe Ecosystems/amazon_investor_parser.py
   ```

2. **Enhanced Analysis with Investor Data:**
   ```bash
   D:/Econometric/.venv/Scripts/python.exe Ecosystems/enhanced_amazon_analysis.py
   ```

3. **Via VS Code Tasks:**
   - `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Task" ‚Üí "Enhanced Amazon Analysis"

### Generated Outputs:
- `investor_reports/parsed_data/metrics_summary.json` - Structured metrics
- `investor_reports/parsed_data/extracted_metrics.csv` - Analysis-ready data
- Enhanced econometric models with segment variables

## üìà Integration with Econometric Models

### New Variables Added:
- `AWS_Revenue_Indicator` - AWS business performance
- `Geographic_Revenue_Indicator` - Regional performance balance
- `Advertising_Revenue_Indicator` - Advertising business growth

- **Business model diversification** - Track revenue stream evolution
- **Operational leverage analysis** - Efficiency and scale effects
- **Strategic initiative impact** - Measure investment outcomes

## üí° Best Practices

### File Organization:
- **Keep files current** - Download latest reports quarterly
- **Maintain naming consistency** - Use clear, dated file names
- **Organize by type** - Separate annual vs. quarterly reports

### Data Quality:
- **Verify extractions** - Review parsed data for accuracy
- **Cross-reference APIs** - Compare with Yahoo Finance data
- **Handle missing data** - Use interpolation for gaps

### Model Integration:
- **Test incremental addition** - Add investor variables gradually
- **Validate relationships** - Ensure logical economic relationships
- **Monitor model performance** - Track R¬≤ and prediction accuracy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Data Limitations:
- **Text extraction accuracy** depends on PDF quality
- **Pattern matching** may miss non-standard formats  
- **Manual verification** recommended for critical metrics

### Legal Considerations:
- **Public information only** - All data is from public filings
- **Academic/research use** - Not for commercial redistribution
- **Attribution required** - Cite original SEC filings

### Technical Requirements:
- **Python packages**: PyPDF2, pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, openpyxl, python-docx
- **Storage space**: ~50-100MB for typical report collection
- **Processing time**: 2-5 minutes for full report set
